## Notes and some thought process

- here ill be taking some notes while i build this

- first create basic nextjs app with app router
- add basic folder structure for the api calls (api/knowledge-base, api/files, api/auth). this is the most important stuff
- add all the shadcn ui components for the frontend
- add global middleware to protect all api routes except for the auth endpoint
- add a basic auth endpoint that uses stack ai to authenticate the user
- add a dashboard page that has a sidebar and a header
